### Code example:

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, except in C, where, to keep the difficulty at the level of the kata, you are given two parameters, the first a buffer with length exactly the same as the second parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

```
function removeChar(str) {
  // Convert string to array
  str_array = str.split('');
  // Remove first letter from array
  str_array[0]='';
  // Remove last letter from array
  str_array[str.length-1]='';
  return str_array.join('');
};

console.log( removeChar('Hello') );
```
